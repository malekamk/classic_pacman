# Pac-Man Game in Python üïπÔ∏è

Welcome to the classic Pac-Man game, reimagined and coded from scratch using Python's `turtle` graphics library! This fun and interactive game provides a great example of real-time game development and graphical programming.

## üéÆ Game Overview

In this game, you control Pac-Man, represented as a yellow circle, and navigate through a grid filled with randomly placed orange food items. Your goal is to "eat" these food items by moving Pac-Man in different directions. 

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move Pac-Man in the four cardinal directions.
- **Dynamic Food Placement**: Food items are placed randomly across the screen and move to new positions once eaten.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The game updates continuously to reflect the current state of Pac-Man and food items.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Setup and Initialization**:
   - The game screen is set up with a black background and a size of 600x600 pixels.
   - Pac-Man and 150 food items are initialized with specific attributes.

2. **Movement Mechanics**:
   - Pac-Man's direction is controlled by the arrow keys.
   - The `move` function updates Pac-Man's position based on its current direction.

3. **Food Interaction**:
   - When Pac-Man is within a certain distance of a food item, the food item is relocated to a new random position on the screen.

4. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - The screen continuously updates to reflect Pac-Man's movement and interactions with food items.

## üíª Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**:
    - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/malekamk/classic_pacman.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd pacman-game
    ```

4. **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    python pacman_game.py
    ```
